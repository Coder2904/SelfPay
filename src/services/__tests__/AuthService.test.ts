// Test placeholders for AuthService functionality
// These tests would be implemented when Jest or another testing framework is configured

/*
Test scenarios to implement:

Mock Authentication:
- should login with valid credentials
- should fail login with invalid credentials  
- should signup new user
- should logout user
- should refresh tokens

Biometric Authentication:
- should setup biometric authentication
- should authenticate with biometrics
- should disable biometric authentication

Token Management:
- should store and retrieve tokens securely
- should detect expired tokens
- should clear all user data on logout

Supabase Integration:
- should initialize Supabase client correctly
- should handle Supabase authentication errors
- should switch between mock and real data modes

Error Handling:
- should handle network errors gracefully
- should handle invalid credentials
- should handle expired tokens
- should handle biometric authentication failures
